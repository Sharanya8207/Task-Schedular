Description:

This is a simple yet effective console-based Task Scheduler built using Java, demonstrating the use of priority queues, stacks, and enums. It allows users to manage tasks by assigning priorities, completing tasks based on urgency, and even undoing completed tasks. The program is interactive, menu-driven, and ideal for practicing Java collections and control flow.

âœ¨ Features:
Add Task: Enter a task with a priority level (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW).

Show Pending Tasks: View all tasks sorted by priority (High â†’ Low).

Complete Task: Removes the highest-priority task from the queue and stores it in a stack of completed tasks.

Undo Last Task: Restores the last completed task back to the pending list.

Exit: Cleanly exits the program.

ðŸ“Œ Data Structures Used:
PriorityQueue: To store and sort tasks by priority.

Stack: To enable undo functionality for the last completed task.

Enum: To represent task priority levels (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW).

ðŸ“‚ Key Concepts Demonstrated:
Java Collections (PriorityQueue, Stack)

Enum usage

Anonymous comparator for custom sorting

Menu-driven user interaction with Scanner

Object-oriented programming principles
